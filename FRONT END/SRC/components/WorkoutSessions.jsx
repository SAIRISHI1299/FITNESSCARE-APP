            <h4>Underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5): Gain Strength</h4>
            <p>
              A high-calorie diet rich in proteins and healthy fats combined with strength-focused exercises is key. Start with bodyweight squats, push-ups, dumbbell rows, and planks to build muscle mass.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Normal Weight */}
          <div>
            <h4>Normal Weight (BMI 18.5 - 24.9): Maintain Fitness</h4>
            <p>
              Maintain your healthy weight with a balanced diet and consistent workouts. Try combining squat-to-press, lunges, and mountain climbers for a 15-minute workout to keep your body in top shape.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Overweight */}
          <div>
            <h4>Overweight (BMI 25 - 29.9): Focus on Fat Loss</h4>
            <p>
              Focus on a high-fiber diet and a calorie deficit. Combine bodyweight exercises such as squats, modified push-ups, and cardio movements like jumping jacks to accelerate fat loss while building strength.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Obese */}
          <div>
            <h4>Obese (BMI 30 and above): Start with Low Impact</h4>
            <p>
              Follow a portion-controlled, nutrient-dense diet while incorporating low-impact exercises like step-ups, wall push-ups, and seated knee lifts to gradually improve mobility and promote weight loss.
